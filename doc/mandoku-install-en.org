* Preview version of Mandoku

  As of late September 2013, a preview version of =Mandoku= is
  available.  This implements a not yet complete new version of
  =Mandoku=.  This preview version can be installed by either
  downloading a package for Mac or for Windows, or by downloading the
  Mandoku library and manually installing it.  The latter is only
  recommended for experienced Emacs users and does not work (well?) on
  Windows.

  Requirements:
  
** Installing a package for Windows
   
   1. Please download the Installation package
