#+TITLE: Index

* Generation of index files

  The files in this directory are for generating a ngram index for
  mandoku texts.  They have been developed and used in early 2010 for
  some collections, some of them are thus very specific.

* plans

  A new index using redis is under development, the files here are
  only made available as a stopgap measure until this new index gets
  available.
